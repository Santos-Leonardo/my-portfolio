# My Portfolio

This repository contains my personal web portfolio, built to showcase the projects, skills, education, awards, and experience I’ve developed over the years as a full-stack developer. The site highlights selected work, technologies, and the areas where I create the most impact.

It serves as a central hub for anyone interested in my work—whether for collaboration, hiring, or simply exploring what I build. The portfolio is fully responsive and was designed with clean, modern UI principles.
